{"name":"Dragon Suit Guy","price":19.99,"description":"<p>“Rarr! I’m bringing the HEAT to this party!”</p><p>The Dragon Suit Guy loves to make things hot.

Or at least burp it.</p>","imageUri":"https://www.lego.com/r/www/r/catalogs/-/media/catalogs/characters/minifigures/series%2018/336x448/71021_lineup_dragon_suit_guy_336x448.jpg?l.r=-621580214","linkUri":"https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/minifigures/characters/dragon-suit-guy-b40acdaab0b94e0cbe15ef09a37e433b","isActive":true,"_id":"h9HrtcnXXIyyeNa6"}
